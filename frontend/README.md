## Description

Born from a request from the FabLab team of Charleroi, composed of Delphine and Sylvain, this project aims to improve the user experience "Client" but especially the user experience "Admin".
Indeed, several tools had to be centralized in order to make the management of reservations, estimates and finally invoicing easier.
The first step of this project was carried out by a Woods 3.21 team composed of :
- :star: [Bastien Dewerse - PM Tech](https://github.com/DewerseB)
- :star: [Nicolas Denoël - PM Orga](https://github.com/nicode-io)
- :star: [Mohamed Shmayssany](https://github.com/M-Shmayssany)
- :star: [Robby Delvaux](https://github.com/Delvaux1986)
- :star: [Simon Duquaine](https://github.com/simonduquaine)

During this one, we were able to create a functional prototype allowing us to reserve a machine during a specific time slot chosen by the client.
A reservation is then established, the rental price of the machine being defined automatically, this one can be modified before validating the final invoice.
On the administrator's side: the administrator can create, modify and delete machines and related products. 
He can consult the reservations through a calendar that allows him to navigate between the days and the different time slots in order to consult the use of the machines.

##  [The Teams](#the-teams)
>   The great people under the hood

### Woods 3.21 
Born from a very nice meeting within the BeCode bootcamp of woods 3.21, our team was ideally composed of both back-end and front-end enthusiasts.

Our two PMs, Bastien and Nicolas, were complementary profiles, one for his technical background and the other for his experience in team management.
Intense exchanges and discussions but often very prolific in terms of results, an enriching experience in terms of project management.

Robby and Mohamed worked with Bastien on the back-end of the project, routing, API, MongoDB/Mongoose etc...
Simon and Nicolas worked on the visual aspect of the components as well as the coherence and unity of the project.

In the end, this first "real" project allowed us to realize the capabilities we have and those we need to acquire as well. From the importance of preparing a project to the importance of respecting a deadline by sometimes making concessions on the final result. A very nice professional experience, but above all a human one.

Thank you Fabulab Team!

### Who's next ?
